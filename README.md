## Setup
*Requires: [obs-websocket plugin](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/releases) for OBS (v4.9 and up)*

* NOTE: obs-websocket alpha 5.0 has not been tested

## [Download *OSC for OBS (v2.7.1)* Now](https://github.com/jshea2/OBSosc/releases)

- [Download *OSC for OBS*](https://github.com/jshea2/OBSosc/releases)   
   - If on Mac: Place *OSC for OBS* in Applications folder
      - If you don't you might get [this error](https://github.com/jshea2/OSC-for-OBS/blob/master/README.md#troubleshooting) on close
- Configure the input fields 
- Successfully "Connect" 
- The window will open a "DevTools" window
     - Make sure it's on the "Console" tab, not "Elements"
- In the "Console" tab it will log IP and Port info, the number of available scenes, and a list of all scenes with numbers 
  - This can be used as an index argument in your **/scene** OSC message
- To save a config file with "Save As" please "Connect" first
- When you close *OSC for OBS* it will save your configuration for when you open next
- There is an option in 'File > Automatically Connect on Startup' that if enabled will automatically connect on opening *OSC for OBS*

## Application OSC -> OSC for OBS 

- In your OSC Application (QLab for example) patch your targeted OSC to match the "OSC IN" inputs on OSC for OBS.
  - default is... IP: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `3333`
- **DO NOT** Use UNDERSCORES in OBS. Only use them in your OSC Address. So, If your OBS Scene or Source name contains a SPACE, then in your OSC message replace the SPACE with an UNDERSCORE.
  - *Example:* if OBS Scene name is `Scene 1`, then your OSC address should use `Scene_1`.
    - *Note:* If OBS names contain UNDERSCORES this will not work. 
- OSC for OBS can be used for any application that transmits and/or receives unbundled OSC. 
  - This was designed with QLab, so the example show file of all the OSC commands is available in Assets on the Github or in the downloaded folder: "Qlab OBSosc Examples.qlab4" 
    - **Note:** Sending OSC Commands requires a paid version of Qlab.
 
#
# OSC Command List:

*Note: a space in the notated syntax indicates the separation between address and argument's*

*Example:* `/scene "Scene 1"` would be...

| address | argument 1 | argument 2 | argument ect... |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| /scene  | Scene 1    |            |                 |

#
## **- Trigger Scenes: -**
#

### by Name in Argument
**`/scene [scene name]`** 
- activate a scene by name in the OSC argument. 
    - *Example:* **`/scene Wide`** will activate a scene named "Wide" in OBS. 
   - *Note:* SPACES will work ok for this format, so `/scene Webcam 1` is valid syntax
   - In QLab you can use quotations to wrap into a single argument: `/scene "Webcam 1"`

### by Index as Scene
**`/scene [index number]`** 
- activate a scene with the index associated from the logged list. 
    - *Example:* `/scene 1` will activate the first scene in OBS.
  - *Note:* Floats will be rounded down.
    - *Example:* `/scene 1.9` = `/scene 1`

### by Name in Address
**`/scene/[scene_name]`** 
- activate a scene by name in the OSC address. 
  - *Example:* `/scene/Wide` will activate a scene named "Wide" in OBS. 
  - *Note:* If a scene name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" make OSC message: `/scene/Webcam_1`

### by TouchOSC
**`/scene/[scene_name]`**
Value `0` to `1`
- activates a scene with name in address and a value of 1 with TouchOSC
   - *Example:* `/scene/Wide` and a value of `0` to `1` will activate the scene "Wide" in OBS
   - *Note:* If a scene name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" make OSC message: `/scene/Webcam_1`
   - See "OBS -> Application" for feedback of active scenes
  
### Next Scene
**`/go`**  
- activates the next scene in the list, if this is triggered on the last scene it will go to the first scene

###  Previous Scene
**`/back`**  
- activates the previous scene in the list, if this is triggered on the first scene it will go to the last scene

#
## **- Set Transition Type and Duration: -**
#
**`/[type]/transition [duration]`**  
- sets the desired transition and duration(in milliseconds).
  - *Example:* `/Cut/transition` will change the current Scene Transition to "Cut". `/Fade/transition 5000` will set the current Scene Transition to "Fade" with a "5000" millisecond duration (5 seconds). 
    - *Note:* `[type]` must be identical to Transition Type name in OBS:
      - `Fade`, `Cut`, `Stinger`, `Fade_to_Color`, `Luma_Wipe`, `Slide`, `Swipe`, and Custom Transition Names. This also works with the `Move` [plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/).
    - If you do not set a duration in the 1st argument it will keep the current duration and log what it is.
#
## **- Set Source Visibility On/Off: -**
#
**`/[scene_name]/[source_name]/visible [0, off, false or 1, on, true]`** 
- turn on or off the source's visibility. 
  - *Example:* `/Webcam_1/Audio_Input_Capture/visible 0` will turn OFF "Audio Input Capture" source in OBS from scene "Webcam 1". Where as `/Webcam_1/Text_1/visible 1` will turn it ON. 
  - *NOTE:* If a scene name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" and a source name of "Text 1" make OSC message the example from above.
#
## **- Set Filter Visibility On/Off: -**
#
**`/[scene_name]/[source_name]/filterVisibility [0, off, false or 1, on, true]`** 
- turn on or off the source's filter visibility.

  - *Note:* If a filter name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a filter "Color Correction" and a source name of "Video Input" make OSC message the example from above.

#
## **- Set Text (for FreeType 2 ONLY): -**
#
**`/[source_name]/setText [text content] [size(optional)] [font (optional)]`**

  - *Note:* Size and Font are optional
  - *Note:* This will not work with 'GDI+', so use 'FreeType 2' instead. On PC you can find it in 'Add > Depricated' 
  - *Example:* `/text_1/setText "Hello World."` will change the text contents of source "text 1" to "Hello World."

  - *Note:* If a source name or filter name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a source "Text 1" and filter "Color Correction" make OSC message the example from above)
#
## **- Set "Color Correction" Filter Properties: -**
#
### Gamma
**`/[source_name]/[color_correction_filter_name]/gamma [-3 thru 3]`** 
- Adjust the Gamma of a source via the "Color Correction" filter in OBS of the current scene.

  - *Example:* `/Text_1/Color_Correction/gamma 3` will make "Text 1" gamma at highest setting. 
  - *Note:* If a source name or filter name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a source "Text 1" and filter "Color Correction" make OSC message the example from above)

### Contrast
**`/[source_name]/[color_correction_filter_name]/contrast [-2 thru 2]`**

  - *Note:* See "Qlab OSC Examples" file for how to automate scale. Also, If a scene name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" and a source name of "Text 1" make OSC message the example from above.)

  - *Example:* `/Webcam_1/Text_1/rotate 90` this will make the rotation of the "Text 1" source 90º clockwise. 
  - *Note:* See "Qlab OSC Examples" file for how to automate rotation. Also, If a scene name or source name contains a SPACE, replace with "_", so if OBS has a scene "Webcam 1" and a source name of "Text 1" make OSC message the example from above.)

# OBS -> Application:


- Configure "OSC OUT" to target Application

- When *Enabled* his allows OBS to send OSC to other applications when a scene is activated.

- To **use/enable** this function, change the toggle button to ON
Configure the prefix and suffix for how you want your OSC application to receive an OSC string from OBS

  - *Example:* In OBS when a Scene named "Wide Shot" is activated, Qlab recieves an OSC message "**/cue/Wide_Shot/start**")

## TouchOSC Feedback:

When *Checked* this sends OSC messages back to TouchOSC for dynamic control. 

- OSC Out IP must be the IP of the device using TouchOSC
- OSC Out Slider must be Enabled


### **Active Scene Feedback**

Use the following setup for `/scene` command for a *push button* in TouchOSC Editor:
